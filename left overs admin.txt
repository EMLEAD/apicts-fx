. Active Plans section on the homepage
Data: add a plans table (name, description, price, features, status, displayOrder).
API: create /api/plans (admin CRUD) and /api/public/plans (public read).
UI: expose a new hero/section on the homepage pulling from public/plans; add admin controls in the dashboard to toggle visibility.
2. Coupons
Models: coupons table (code, type, value, maxRedemptions, startsAt, endsAt, status); coupon_redemptions to track usage.
Backend: admin endpoints for creating and managing coupons; user checkout/transaction endpoints must accept a coupon code and enforce business rules.
Front end: admin form in dashboard; user-facing apply-coupon UI (likely on wallet/deposit flows).
3. Deposit & Withdrawal flows
Transactions table: extend existing schema to store type (deposit / withdrawal), amount, status, metadata.
Process:
Admin: manual approval queue & audit trail.
User: deposit method selection, proof upload (if needed), withdrawal request form.
Integrations: if you plan to hook into payment gateways, abstract that behind service classes so you can swap providers later.
4. Transfers (user-to-user or internal accounts)
Business rules: who can transfer, limits, fees.
Backend: service that debits sender, credits recipient atomically, logs both sides.
UI: transfer form in wallet section, admin oversight page to review flagged transfers.
5. Referral links
Schema: add referralCode and referredBy columns on users; create a referrals table for tracking bonuses/status.
Flow: generate unique referral URLs, set cookies on signup, credit both parties after qualifying action.
Dashboard: admin analytics view + user view showing referral stats.
6. Become an Affiliate
Application: allow users to apply (form, status pending/approved).
Permissions: affiliate-only dashboard with marketing assets, performance metrics.
Admin tools: approve/deny applications, adjust payout logic.
7. Admins & Sub-admins
Roles & permissions: add roles and permissions tables (or a role enum plus per-role capabilities). Example roles: super_admin, admin, manager, support.
Access control: update middleware to enforce role-based access (route protections, component rendering).
UI: “User Management” page for admins to invite or downgrade staff accounts.
8. Editable “most important content”
Identify content: e.g., hero headlines, CTA copy, feature cards, FAQs.
Storage: create a cms_blocks table (slug, title, content JSON/markup).
Editing UI: build a simple CMS inside the admin dashboard with form-based editors, preview, publish/draft states.
Frontend rendering: fetch content via API or load server-side and hydrate on the client.
Versioning/backups: consider storing revision history to roll back mistakes.
Implementation Workflow
Data layer: extend Sequelize models & migrations.
API layer: add Next.js route handlers with validation, RBAC, and error handling.
Client: extend dashboard layout with new navigation and pages, wire up forms, handle optimistic updates where it improves UX.
Content editing: ensure frontend pulls from APIs instead of hard-coded strings.
Testing: add unit tests for services, integration tests for key flows (auth, payments, referrals).
Deployment: run DB migrations, seed initial data, update environment variables, and expose new routes through middleware.
If you’d like me to start scaffolding models, API routes, or admin UI, just toggle to Agent Mode and say the word!
